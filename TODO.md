# TODO

- add pr-agent?

# Next

- main branch protection
- Model Files / Splits - how to interface as customer? Internal should be same?
- consider ruff
- SaaS versus internal, dogfood

# Done

- Start structure
- LICENSE
- how to install postgres
- devcontainer
- devcontainer history
- GH actions build/test/lint python
  - Same devcontainer works for both? no, maybe later, still early
  - choose python linting tool (black)
- testproj README, all READMEs at all levels
