# TODO

- Model Files / Splits - how to interface as customer? Internal should be same?
  - CLI, API, is there a way to talk to DB directly? LFG

# Next

- consider ruff
- pr-agent only on comments?
- SaaS versus internal, dogfood

# Done

- Start structure
- LICENSE
- how to install postgres
- devcontainer
- devcontainer history
- GH actions build/test/lint python
