# py/packages/

Modular Python packages for **Corpora**. Each package is designed to be self-contained, with its own dependencies and functionality, enabling isolated development and easy distribution.

## Packages

- [**corpora/**](corpora/README.md): Core Django app providing tools for self-enhancement and evolution.
- [**corpora_proj/**](corpora_proj/README.md): Django project for testing and development.

Each package includes its own `requirements.txt` for dependencies, while the main `requirements.txt` in `py/` aggregates them all for streamlined installation.
