# py/

Python codebase for **Corpora** â€” a collection of tools to enhance and evolve arbitrary corpora.

## Contents

- [**packages/**](packages/README.md): Python packages
- [**requirements.txt**](requirements.txt): Combined dependencies for all Python packages and development tools.

## Quickstart

The whole repo can be used on any host machine with any editor but you will be responsible for installing the necessary dependencies. If you have Docker installed, you can use the provided `devcontainer` to get started quickly.

The below assumes you want to use the devcontainer with VSCode.

### Prerequisites

- [**Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [**git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)


### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skyl/corpora.git
```

2. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code.

3. CMD+Shift+P (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows) to open the command palette and select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.


<!-- To preserve your history in the devcontainer, create a history file ON YOUR HOST:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.vscode-zsh-histories
touch ~/.vscode-zsh-histories/corpora.zsh_history
``` -->
