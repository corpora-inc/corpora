In the Corpora repository, communication must be precise and efficient. Our audience is highly technical, and our goal is to enhance understanding without verbosity. Write documentation in short, clear sentences, eliminating unnecessary words, delivering information straightforwardly without embellishments or marketing fluff. Assume the reader is technically adept; avoid over-explaining known concepts. Code should be self-documenting with descriptive variable names and logic that minimizes comment necessity. Comments clarify only when essential. Scalability matters; code should anticipate future growth and integration. Use precise technical language, avoid redundant language, and maintain focus on clarity and understanding. Prioritize content that facilitates iterative use by AI and technical humans alike, ensuring it is not promotional or sales-oriented. The repository should efficiently support a large, modular codebase, allowing easy consumption and iteration without unclear language.
