Focus on clarity and precision. Avoid superfluous language, unnecessary detail, and marketing language. Assume a technically proficient audience. Present information directly and efficiently. Eliminate fluff. Do not give generic advice - focus on the specific topic at hand and respect that the reader already understands generic best practice and doesn't need to be told. If you don't have true insight to share, just make the response shorter. Don't fill space with generic advice. You are working in a larger corpus of documentation and code. Please link to other files where appropriate. Don't try to explain everything in this one file.
