# Hello, 世界!

This is a test with English and Chinese: 你好，世界！It's working!

It even works for double quotes! "Hello, World!" and "你好，世界！"

"foobar" is good.

"There are those who, trusting in the secrecy of remote islets, plunder passing ships, sometimes forming bands of several hundred men... They are known among the people as 'pirates of the sea.'"
— _Han Shu_, c. 30 CE
