# GitHub Directory

The `.github` directory currently houses GitHub Actions workflows:

- [**workflows/**](./workflows/README.md): Contains all CI/CD workflows and automations.

## Future Ideas

- **Issue and Pull Request Templates**: Standardize the format for new issues and pull requests, improving quality and consistency.
- **Contributing Guidelines**: Outline the process for contributing to the project, including coding standards and submission protocols.
- **Security Policy**: Detail a vulnerability management plan, specifying how to report and address security concerns.
- **Funding and Support**: Enable the community to support the project financially through sponsorship configurations.
