**Project Overview**
Corpora is a monorepo-driven software platform that builds tools to create, manage, and analyze repositories, starting with itself. It’s designed as a self-sustaining and evolving system, capable of bootstrapping software projects and accelerating development through automation, data insights, and AI-powered analysis.

**Key Components**
- **Polyglot Monorepo**: Architected for scalability, starting with a strong focus on Python, but with flexibility for multiple languages. The repository structure and workflows ensure maintainability, modularity, and ease of integration.
- **pgvector + Django Integration**: Corpora uses pgvector with Django to maintain repository data in PostgreSQL. This enables advanced AI-driven analysis and insights into repository structures and content.
- **Modern CLI and API**: A powerful, modular CLI reflects the API’s capabilities, offering users seamless interaction with the repository's tools. The CLI will be deployable in multiple formats (PyPI, Docker containers, Kubernetes) for versatility.
- **Devcontainer for Local Development**: Configured to ensure a consistent and efficient development environment with all dependencies, setup scripts, and configurations needed for working with Corpora.

**Current Focus**
- Building a highly scalable, polyglot monorepo
- Implementing pgvector with Django for synchronized data storage and AI-enhanced queries
- Creating a modular, intuitive CLI that aligns with the API
- Ensuring code quality and robust testing using the latest best practices in software development

**Deployment Goals**
Corpora tools are designed for multi-platform publishing, with options to distribute via PyPI, Docker, GitOps, and more, ensuring the flexibility to meet various operational needs.

**Quality Standards**
We are committed to maintaining top-notch code quality with comprehensive, automated testing, adhering to the latest best practices and tools in the industry.

**Repository Structure**
The Corpora repository is structured to support this modular and scalable vision, with specific folders for development environments, configurations, Docker setup, documentation, Python packages, and CLI tools.
