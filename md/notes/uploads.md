You’re correct; the approaches I described in Django Ninja are synchronous, and they essentially block the request until the file is fully processed. This can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially with large files, since it ties up server resources. In these cases, handling the file asynchronously or through streaming would be ideal. Here are some ways to handle file uploads in a more scalable, non-blocking way in Django Ninja:

### 1. **Using Asynchronous Views with Django Ninja**

Although Django Ninja itself doesn’t natively support asynchronous handling of uploads, you can create asynchronous views using Django's async capabilities. However, file uploads are typically limited in async views since the standard file handling relies on synchronous I/O operations.

Here's how an async view might look, but bear in mind it doesn’t truly stream the file:

```python
from ninja import NinjaAPI, File
from ninja.files import UploadedFile

api = NinjaAPI()

@api.post("/upload-large")
async def upload_large(request, file: UploadedFile = File(...)):
    with open(f'/path/to/save/{file.name}', 'wb+') as destination:
        for chunk in file.chunks():
            destination.write(chunk)
    return {'name': file.name, 'size': file.size}
```

This asynchronous function is compatible with Django's async features, but it won’t provide true non-blocking I/O for the file operations themselves.

### 2. **Using Django Channels for Asynchronous File Uploads**

For true asynchronous streaming, integrating **Django Channels** with **WebSockets** or **Django REST Framework (DRF) with Django Ninja** allows you to handle file uploads in smaller chunks. This is especially helpful for large files:

- **Step 1**: Set up Django Channels to handle WebSocket connections.
- **Step 2**: Split the file on the client side and send chunks via WebSockets.
- **Step 3**: On the server, reassemble the file chunks as they arrive.

This approach is more complex to implement but enables you to process file uploads in real time without blocking other requests.

### 3. **Leveraging External Storage with Direct Uploads**

For extremely large files, you might consider offloading the file upload to a third-party service like AWS S3, where the client directly uploads to the storage provider. Here’s a simplified workflow:

1. Generate a pre-signed URL from your backend.
2. The client directly uploads to the storage service using the pre-signed URL.
3. Your Django app only handles metadata or processes the file after it's uploaded.

This setup minimizes the load on your Django server, allowing you to handle large uploads without blocking the request.

### 4. **Using Django-Chunked-Upload**

Another option is the [Django-Chunked-Upload](https://github.com/juliomalegria/django-chunked-upload) library, which lets you handle file uploads in chunks within Django. This library can integrate with Django Ninja and provides a cleaner, chunked upload experience:

- The client uploads the file in chunks.
- Each chunk is processed and saved on the server.
- Once all chunks are received, they are assembled into a complete file.

This is less complex than setting up Django Channels but still provides more control and scalability than a single synchronous file upload.

Each of these options has trade-offs in terms of implementation complexity, performance, and user experience.
