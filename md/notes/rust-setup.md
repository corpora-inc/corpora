### Notes on the Rust Workspace Structure and Client Setup (`rs/`)

The `rs/` directory in the Corpora project is a multipackage Rust workspace designed for scalability, modularity, and seamless integration into the broader monorepo. The workspace is fully configured within the devcontainer, ensuring a consistent and reproducible development environment without requiring external installations.

---

## Workspace Structure

The Rust workspace is set up to support multiple interrelated Rust packages. At a high level:

- **`corpora_cli`**: A Rust-based command-line interface (CLI) tool for interacting with the Corpora system. This package is structured as a binary crate (`main.rs`) and acts as the entry point for CLI interactions.
- **`corpora_client`**: A generated Rust library providing an API client for interacting with the Corpora backend. It includes:
  - **`apis/`**: Contains API clients generated from the OpenAPI specification, grouped by functionality.
  - **`models/`**: Data models corresponding to the backend schemas, also generated from the OpenAPI spec.
- **Workspace Configuration**: The `Cargo.toml` at the root defines the workspace and its member packages, ensuring dependency sharing and consistent builds.

The directory structure is modular to allow for additional Rust packages to be added in the future without disrupting the existing setup.

## `genall.sh`: Regenerating the Client

The `genall.sh` script is central to maintaining the `corpora_client` package. It automates the process of regenerating the Rust API client using the OpenAPI Generator and ensures the generated code aligns with the backend's latest API specifications.

### Why This Matters
- **Decoupling Backend Updates**: Regenerating the client ensures that the API library remains in sync with backend changes without requiring manual updates.
- **Future-Proofing**: By relying on an OpenAPI spec, the client adapts to evolving backend endpoints and schemas with minimal developer intervention.

### What It Does
- Reads configuration from `openapitools.json`.
- Uses OpenAPI Generator with customized templates (`templates/`) to produce idiomatic Rust code.
- Updates the `corpora_client` package's API and model files.

### Usage
The script is preconfigured to run seamlessly within the devcontainer. Developers only need to execute:

```sh
cd rs
./genall.sh
```

No additional setup or dependencies are required thanks to the pre-installed tools in the devcontainer.

---

## Why This Setup?

### Modularity
The separation of `corpora_cli` and `corpora_client` allows for:
- Independent development and testing of the client library and the CLI tool.
- Future Rust packages to be added under the `rs/core/` structure.

### Scalability
- The workspace setup supports adding more Rust crates, whether libraries or binaries, as the project grows.
- The generated client ensures compatibility with API changes while keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.

### Automation
The inclusion of `genall.sh` and the use of templates means:
- Developers donâ€™t need to manage the client library manually.
- Customizations to the generated code can be made through templates, maintaining consistency across versions.

## Future-Proofing

This document avoids locking into the exact current state of the workspace. The key principles of this setup are:
- **Flexibility**: The workspace is designed to adapt to new requirements, including additional packages or restructuring.
- **Automation**: Tools like `genall.sh` and OpenAPI Generator streamline workflows, reducing manual maintenance.
- **Consistency**: All configurations and dependencies are encapsulated in the devcontainer, ensuring a unified development experience.

As the Rust workspace evolves, these principles will continue to guide its growth and utility within the Corpora project.
