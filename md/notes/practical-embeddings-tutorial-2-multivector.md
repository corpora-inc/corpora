### 1. Overview of Multi-Vector Models and ColBERT

**ColBERT** (Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT) is a multi-vector model that generates a vector for each token in a document, enabling high-resolution semantic matching. This token-level approach allows for detailed similarity matching between query terms and document terms.

- **Dimensionality**: ColBERT commonly uses **128-dimensional embeddings per token**, balancing semantic accuracy with manageable storage.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for applications where granular matching (e.g., term-to-term or passage-to-passage) is needed, such as search in code repositories, books, or large document corpora.

With ColBERT, each document is represented by an array of vectors, capturing the context of individual tokens, which can improve search precision.

### 2. Setting Up Multi-Vector Embeddings in Django with pgvector

#### Database Schema Design

To store multi-vector embeddings in PostgreSQL with `pgvector`, you can leverage PostgreSQL’s array functionality. Each document will have an array of 128-dimensional vectors, one per token.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Install pgvector and Set Up PostgreSQL**

   Make sure PostgreSQL has `pgvector` installed. If not, install it with:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
   ```

2. **Define Django Model for Multi-Vector Embeddings**

   Use Django’s `ArrayField` along with `VectorField` from `pgvector.django`. Here’s how to define a model that stores multiple 128-dimensional vectors for each document:

   ```python
   from django.db import models
   from django.contrib.postgres.fields import ArrayField
   from pgvector.django import VectorField

   class Document(models.Model):
       content = models.TextField()
       embeddings = ArrayField(
           base_field=VectorField(dimensions=128),  # 128 dimensions per token vector
           size=None,  # None allows for variable-length arrays
       )
   ```

   - **`content`**: Stores the raw text of the document.
   - **`embeddings`**: An array field where each element is a 128-dimensional vector representing a token embedding.

3. **Generate and Store Multi-Vector Embeddings**

   Use ColBERT to generate an embedding for each token in a document. Here’s a sample function that could generate and store these embeddings:

   ```python
   from transformers import ColBERTTokenizer, ColBERTModel
   import torch

   # Assume ColBERTModel and ColBERTTokenizer are set up correctly
   tokenizer = ColBERTTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
   model = ColBERTModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

   def generate_and_store_embeddings(document_text):
       # Tokenize and obtain embeddings for each token
       inputs = tokenizer(document_text, return_tensors="pt")
       embeddings = model(**inputs).last_hidden_state.squeeze().detach().numpy()

       # Convert embeddings to a list of lists for storage
       embeddings_list = embeddings.tolist()[:128]  # Limit to 128 dimensions

       # Store in Django
       document = Document(content=document_text, embeddings=embeddings_list)
       document.save()
   ```

   This example assumes that each token in `document_text` has been converted to a 128-dimensional vector. After generation, the vectors are stored in the `embeddings` array field.

#### Indexing for Efficient Retrieval

Create an index on the embeddings array to speed up similarity searches:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON document_embeddings USING ivfflat (embeddings);
```

This index enables faster nearest neighbor searches within the vector space.

### 3. Practical Storage and Retrieval with Multi-Vectors

With multi-vector embeddings stored, we can now perform searches that take advantage of the fine-grained information embedded in each token’s vector.

#### Example Query for Similarity Search with Late Interaction

When performing a search query, you generate embeddings for the query terms and compare them against the token-level embeddings of each document.

Here’s an example using Django to retrieve similar documents based on a multi-vector query:

```python
from django.db.models import F
from pgvector.django import CosineDistance

def find_similar_documents(query_text):
    # Generate multi-vector embeddings for query text
    query_embeddings = get_embeddings_for_text(query_text)

    # Perform similarity search against stored embeddings
    results = Document.objects.annotate(
        similarity=CosineDistance(F("embeddings"), query_embeddings)
    ).order_by("similarity")[:10]

    return results
```

In this example:
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures similarity between the query embeddings and each document’s token embeddings, allowing for granular matching.
- **Late Interaction**: This function calculates similarity scores by interacting with each token embedding, offering higher precision in retrieval.

### Practical Considerations

1. **Storage Requirements**: Multi-vector embeddings require more storage than single-vector embeddings. Each token embedding adds data, so ensure your database can handle the additional storage requirements.

2. **Query Performance**: Multi-vector queries are more computationally intensive. Indexing, caching, and query optimization can help maintain acceptable performance.

3. **Adjustable Dimensionality**: If storage is a concern, consider reducing the dimensionality (e.g., to 64 or 32 dimensions) to lower storage requirements, though this may reduce search accuracy.

### Summary

Using ColBERT-style multi-vector embeddings with `pgvector` in Django enables a high-resolution search experience, ideal for complex corpora like code repositories or large document collections.

- **Define Multi-Vector Storage**: Use `ArrayField` and `VectorField` to store arrays of vectors, representing token-level embeddings.
- **Efficient Querying**: Use Cosine similarity with late interaction to retrieve relevant results based on fine-grained semantic matches.
- **Performance and Storage Management**: Balance dimensionality, indexing, and storage to optimize for both accuracy and performance.

This setup provides a robust foundation for implementing advanced search capabilities within a Django application, leveraging the power of multi-vector embeddings and `pgvector`.
